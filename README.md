We go through creating 3 different kinds of NFTs.

1. A Basic NFT
2. IPFS Hosted NFT
   - That uses Randomness to generate a unique NFT
   - Pros: Cheap
   - Cons: Someone need to pins our data
3. SVG NFT (Hosted 100% on-chain)
   - Uses price feeds to be dynamic, If price of ETH above X -> Happy face. If it below -> Frown face
   - Pros: The data is onchain
   - Cons: Much more expensive
